# GitHub Repositories Contributors Plugin Updates

## Fixed Issues

### GitHub Client Initialization Issue
The GitHub client initialization issue when clicking refresh buttons has been fixed with the following improvements:

1. **Added `reinitialize()` Method**: 
   - Added a public method to force reinitialization of the client
   - This is called before each data fetch in the refresh handlers

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added consistent error handling across all API methods
   - Added more specific error messages to help with debugging
   - Each method now properly catches and processes errors

3. **Updated Components**:
   - All three components (MyPullRequestsCard, ActionRequiredPullRequestsCard, ContributorRepositoriesCard) now call `reinitialize()` before fetching data
   - Components will display appropriate error messages if initialization fails

## How to Test the Changes

1. **Using the Browser Console**:
   - After loading the Backstage app, open the browser console
   - Copy the `runBrowserTest()` function from `test-github-client.js`
   - Paste it into the console and run it to test all API methods

2. **Through the UI**:
   - Navigate to the Backstage homepage
   - Click the refresh button on any of the GitHub cards
   - Verify that data is loaded correctly without errors

## Implementation Details

### Key Files Modified:

1. **`GitHubContributorsApiClient.ts`**:
   - Added `reinitialize()` method to API interface
   - Enhanced `initialize()` method to accept a `forceRefresh` parameter
   - Improved error handling with consistent try-catch blocks
   - Added more specific error messages

2. **Component Files**:
   - Updated `fetchPullRequests` and `fetchRepositories` methods to call `reinitialize()`
   - Added better error handling and state management

### Testing:

The `test-github-client.js` file includes two testing methods:
- Command-line testing (using Node.js)
- Browser console testing (via `runBrowserTest()` function)

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing the plugin with real GitHub data
2. Monitor for any potential edge cases or error scenarios
3. Consider adding better user feedback during loading and error states
