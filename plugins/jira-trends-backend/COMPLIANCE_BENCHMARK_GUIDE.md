## üéØ Overview

The Jira Trends plugin has been enhanced with comprehensive compliance tracking and benchmark management features. This guide explains how teams can leverage these features to maintain high performance standards and ensure continuous improvement.

## üìä Enhanced Sprint Metrics

### Core KPIs Tracked

| Metric | Description | Benchmark Example | Compliance Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Velocity** | Total completed story points | ‚â• 40 SP | PASS ‚â• 40, WARN ‚â• 30, FAIL < 30 |
| **Churn Rate** | % of stories added/removed after sprint start | ‚â§ 10% | PASS ‚â§ 10%, WARN ‚â§ 20%, FAIL > 20% |
| **Completion Ratio** | Ratio of planned to delivered work | ‚â• 85% | PASS ‚â• 85%, WARN ‚â• 70%, FAIL < 70% |
| **Bug/Defect Count** | Count of `type=Bug` issues | ‚â§ 5 bugs | PASS ‚â§ 5, WARN ‚â§ 8, FAIL > 8 |
| **Team Stability** | % of consistent team members | ‚â• 75% | PASS ‚â• 75%, WARN ‚â• 60%, FAIL < 60% |
| **Cycle Time** | Average time from start to completion | ‚â§ 5 days | PASS ‚â§ 5, WARN ‚â§ 8, FAIL > 8 |

### Enhanced Trend Metrics

- **Burndown Efficiency**: Calculated based on completion ratio and cycle time
- **Quality Score**: Derived from defect rate and completion metrics
- **Delivery Predictability**: Historical completion ratio consistency
- **Team Change Impact**: Analysis of team composition changes

## üîí Compliance System

### Compliance Objectives

Each sprint metric is evaluated against **configurable industry benchmarks** to produce compliance status:

- **PASS** ‚úÖ: Metric meets or exceeds target benchmark
- **WARN** ‚ö†Ô∏è: Metric is below target but within acceptable range  
- **FAIL** ‚ùå: Metric significantly deviates from acceptable standards

### Compliance Card Features

- **Real-time Status Indicators**: Color-coded compliance status for each metric
- **Benchmark Comparison**: Shows actual vs. target values with deviation percentages
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical performance tracking with improvement/decline indicators
- **Actionable Recommendations**: AI-generated suggestions based on compliance results
- **Admin Controls**: Edit benchmarks button (visible to admin users only)

## üìà Benchmark Configuration

### Default Industry Benchmarks

The system comes pre-configured with industry-standard benchmarks:

```typescript
const defaultBenchmarks = [
  {
    metricName: 'velocity',
    target: 40,           // Story points per sprint
    warning: 30,
    unit: 'story points',
    category: 'delivery'
  },
  {
    metricName: 'churnRate',
    target: 0.10,         // 10% max scope change
    warning: 0.20,
    unit: 'percentage',
    category: 'stability'
  },
  {
    metricName: 'completionRatio',
    target: 0.85,         // 85% completion rate
    warning: 0.70,
    unit: 'percentage',
    category: 'delivery'
  }
  // ... additional benchmarks
];
```

### Customizing Benchmarks

Administrators can update benchmarks through the API or frontend interface:

1. **Access Admin Panel**: Visible to users with admin permissions
2. **Edit Benchmark**: Click edit button on benchmark card
3. **Update Thresholds**: Modify target and warning values
